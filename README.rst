Agora
=====

Agora is a Pinax app for forums. It is focused on core forum
functionality and hence is expected to be combined with other Pinax apps
for broader features.

See `Pinax Forums`_ for a full Django project incorporating numerous
apps with the goal of providing an out of the box forums solution.

Agora was originally built by Eldarion, incorporating code and ideas
from various client projects. The clients were kind enough to allow
Eldarion to open source the app and contribute it to Pinax.
