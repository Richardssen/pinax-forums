Pinax
------

Pinax is an open-source platform built on the Django Web Framework. It is an ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and starter project templates. 
This collection can be found at http://pinaxproject.com.

This app was developed as part of the Pinax ecosystem but is just a Django app and can be used independently of other Pinax apps.


pinax-forums
-------------

``pinax-forums`` is an extensible forums app for Django and Pinax. It is focused on core forum
functionality and hence is expected to be combined with other Pinax apps
for broader features.

See `pinax-project-forums`_ for a full Django project incorporating numerous
apps with the goal of providing an out of the box forums solution.


History
---------

``pinax-forums`` was originally built by Eldarion and called `agora`. It incorporate
code and ideas from various client projects. The clients were kind enough to allow
Eldarion to open source the app and contribute it to Pinax.
